MiddMedia Change Log


v. 0.6.0 (2009-11-18)
----------------------------------------------------
This release changes support for group-directory naming to allow multiple directory
definitions per group. This change will allow directories to be created based on
multiple criteria, not just a single property.
		
		
	* Change: 
		Changed group-name callbacks to return an array of names for a group rather
		than a single string.
		(2009-11-18 - Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Fix for CAS authentication redirects to return users to their previous
		location after login.
		(2009-11-18 - Adam Franco)
	



v. 0.5.0 (2009-10-09)
----------------------------------------------------
This release adds support for CAS authentication.

If going to CAS authentication from LDAP, enable both authentication methods, then
run the updater under Admin Tools --> MiddMedia Updates to map LDAP ids to CAS ids.

From there both authentication methods can be left enabled or the LDAP method can
be disabled.

Authentication configuration has changed to support the reworked admin-act-as-user
authentication method.

 This release of MiddMedia uses Harmoni 1.10.0 and Polyphony 1.5.3.

rely on these methods for render-time access to embed-code.

		same return value as getVideo(username, password, directory, file), but does
		not require a username and password.

	* New feature: 
		New RESTful service point at
		middmedia/getEmbedCode.php?directory=xxx&file=yyy. A simple GET request will
