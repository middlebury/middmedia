This release adds support for the extraction of frames from video and the generation
of thumbnail and splash images from those frames.

Every video file will have a matching image with the '.jpg' extension in each of
the three subdirectories below that in which the video is located: full_frame/,
thumb/, splash/. The full-frame is the same dimensions as the video file. The
splash-image is the full-frame image with a 'play' icon overlayed. The thumbnail is
a maximum of 200x200 pixels.

This release also fixes a few other bugs. See the change-log for details.
